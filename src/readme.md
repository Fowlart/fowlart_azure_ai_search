# Application: Intelligent Document Summarization and Search

## Core Functionality:

Users upload documents (e.g., ~~PDFs, Word docs~~, **text files**).

Python code processes the documents:
Extracts text using libraries like PyPDF2, docx, or plain file reading. 

  1. Cleans the text (remove noise, punctuation, etc.).
  2. Perform sentiment analysis (**Azure AI Language services**).
  3. Extract key phrases and entities (**Azure AI Language services**).
  4. Perform language detection (**Azure AI Language services**).
  5. Full-text indexing for search(**AI Search**).
  6. Faceting options (e.g., document type, sentiment, language, entities)(**AI Search**).
  7. Search & Summarization: Users perform keyword searches. Azure AI Search retrieves relevant documents. 
  8. Python code uses Azure AI Language services (e.g., Text Summarization) to generate concise summaries of the retrieved documents. 
  9. The application presents search results with summaries, key phrases, and relevant metadata (facets). 

## Enhancements (Optional):

1. Create a user-friendly web or desktop interface using libraries like Flask or Streamlit.
2. Advanced Search: Implement more advanced search features (e.g., fuzzy search, semantic search).
3. Sentiment Analysis Visualization: Visualize sentiment trends across documents.
4. Machine Learning Integration: Train a custom machine learning model for document classification or summarization.
